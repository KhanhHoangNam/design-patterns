## Introduction

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a standard way to structure and solve recurring issues in software development. This project serves as a reference for understanding and implementing these patterns in Java.

## Design Patterns Overview

### Creational Patterns
These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation:
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Factory Method**
- **Singleton**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and structure:
- **Adapter**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Proxy**
- **Bridge**

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects:
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Observer**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **State**
- **Mediator**

### Other Patterns
- **Service Locator**
